Introduction 

COVID-19 outbreak is the worst crisis seen by the world in 21st century so far. COVID-19 transfers from person to person via touch.The disease which was generated from China has affected peoplesâ€™ health, economy of countries and challenged the health facilities of every nation whether it is developed like USA, Italy or under development like India.Vaccine or antidote of this disease is not available yet and developed counties are putting their all efforts to find a cure but till now prevention is the only technique to avoid this disease.In this study we find and discussed the effects of outbreak on people and economy of India along with predicting next 30 days total cases, recoveries and deaths due to the disease in India using both mathematical and machine learning models.In addition to this, analysis of medical facilities like different types of hospitals and public health centers and occupancy of beds in them, along with control measures done by government in order to reduce rapid spread of disease and analysis of economical effects on Indian stock markets is also done.The study and finding and analysis of this research will help understanding the overall current COVID-19 situation of India and its states and how much worse situation can become in future so that government can take measure in accordance to that.

Findings And Results

In this research paper, we tried to describe COVID-19 disease effects on almost every aspect of country India by using SEIR and Regression model to forecast data of disease spread in India and most of its states, analysis of various types of hospitals and their occupancy, analysis of control measures introduced by government till now and discussing what other measures government can take, doing sentiment analysis of Indian people and discuss reasoning behind each polarity and at last analysis of different stock prices categorized by industry to see the economical effects of COVID-19 outbreak on India.A range of R0 values were taken for India to plot SEIR graph and on the other hand, R0 values of states were already available and Regression model predicted the next 30 days COVID-19 cases for India and its states.In addition to all of this, total days to infect whole India and its states using R0 were also calculated.

Data of almost all the sections was taken from 30th January, 2020 to 4th May, 2020. Findings showed that COVID-19 cases trend is going upwards and stocks prices trends of almost every industry is going downwards and only Pharmacy industry is in profit during this outbreak.So it is being suggested that government should introduce some measures to control economy and disease spread at same time which is a very challenging task though so far government has done a pretty well job terms of taking control measures like imposing visa and travel bans at early stages and giving relaxations to farmers on loan repayment.Suggestion is also that government should focus more on hospital facilities and testings. Although there is good relationship between hospitals and beds they have but if India keep seeing upward trend then there might be shortage of them because India has large population.Apart from that, sentiment analysis done on the data of 12th April shows that people are mostly neutral or positive about fighting with the disease while only few of them are negative.So, government actions are supported by most of the people but few more strict measures should have to taken in order to control the spread and GDP.
